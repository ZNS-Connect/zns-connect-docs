# ZNS Subgraph

Developing a subgraph for the ZNS protocol, which is based on ENS contracts, requires providing specific additional information.

#### üîç Domain Search on INK Explorer

ZNS domains on INK (like `hello.ink`) are now fully integrated with the official INK [Blockscout Explorer.](https://explorer.inkonchain.com/)\
Users can search for `.ink` names directly ‚Äî just like they do for wallet addresses or ENS names.

‚úÖ Live Example: `hello.ink`

The ZNS protocol has a constant variable called **`identifier`** that uniquely describes the protocol across multiple chains. This value is crucial for calculating the namehash, and therefore, the subgraph should be aware of it.

Blockscout and ZNS are excited to announce their collaboration, aimed at enhancing flexibility and features in name service implementations. This partnership leverages the strengths of both platforms to provide a seamless user experience for discovering and managing decentralized applications (DApps) and name services.

Blockscout now supports Name Services for chains, including ZNS for <mark style="color:purple;">**INK,  Polygon, and Blast.**</mark> Users can search by name in the search bar or use the dedicated Name Services lookup page accessible from the Blockscout Explorer:&#x20;

#### Developing a Subgraph for ZNS

Creating a subgraph for the ZNS protocol, which is based on ENS contracts, involves providing specific additional information. The ZNS protocol includes a constant variable called "**identifier**" that uniquely describes the protocol across multiple chains.

#### Conclusion

The partnership between Blockscout and ZNS marks a significant step forward in enhancing the user experience for name service implementations. By integrating ZNS into Blockscout Explorer and developing a robust subgraph for the ZNS protocol, we are making it easier for users to navigate and utilize decentralized applications and services.
