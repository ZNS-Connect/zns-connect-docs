# Terms of Use

Terms of Use Last Updated: 25/05/2025

#### **AGREEMENT TO TERMS**

ABOUT THESE TERMS

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement between you and ALTBridge Labs S.A. (operating as ZNS Connect) (“Company,” “we,” or “us”) regarding your access to and use of the ZNS Connect websites including https://znsconnect.io, https://zns.bio, and https://app.znsconnect.io, and all related content, products, and services (collectively, the “Site”).

Please note: While ZNS Connect may publish Domain Names or other records to public blockchain networks, these networks are operated by independent third parties and are not part of the Site.

By accessing the Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must discontinue use of the Site immediately.

Supplemental terms, policies, or disclosures linked on the Site are incorporated into these Terms by reference.

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. By continuing to use the Site after such modifications are posted, you agree to the revised Terms.

The Site is not intended for distribution or use in any jurisdiction where such use would violate law or require regulatory registration. Users are responsible for compliance with their local laws.

The Site is intended only for users aged 18 years and older. By using the Site, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age.

#### 1. Web3 Domain Disclosure

Web3 domains reside on public blockchains and grant users ownership over their data and identities. They simplify crypto transactions by replacing complex wallet addresses with human-readable names and serve as decentralized identifiers for applications and platforms across Web3.

Unlike traditional DNS domains, Web3 domains:

* Are not issued or regulated by ICANN.
* Do not use the DNS root zone and thus may not resolve on standard browsers without special plugins or configurations.
* May not be unique across all blockchains and platforms, and could potentially collide with other blockchain-based naming systems or existing DNS domains.

By purchasing or using a ZNS Connect domain, you acknowledge and accept that Web3 naming is an experimental and rapidly evolving space, and that ZNS Connect makes no guarantees regarding long-term resolution compatibility or exclusivity.

#### 2. Eligibility and User Representations

You may use the Site only if you are at least 18 years old and capable of entering into a legally binding agreement.

#### 4. No Financial Advice or Offerings

**4.1 No Financial or Investment Advice**\
Information available on the Site (including, without limitation, documentation, dashboards, tokenomics pages, blog posts, or community content) is provided for general informational and educational purposes only.\
Nothing on the Site, in our documentation, or in any communication from us or our partners constitutes:

* Investment, financial, legal, tax or accounting advice;
* An offer, solicitation or recommendation to buy or sell any security, commodity, or other regulated financial instrument; or
* A guarantee or representation regarding the future price, utility, or performance of any digital asset, including the $ZNS token.

You are solely responsible for performing your own due diligence and for any decision to participate in the $ZNS token sale or to acquire, hold, or dispose of any digital asset.

**4.2 Nature of $ZNS Tokens**\
$ZNS is a utility token designed to power access to and usage of the multi-chain ZNS Connect ecosystem, including (without limitation) domain registrations, identity features, protocol discounts, governance, and other in-app utilities as further described in our documentation.

$ZNS tokens:

* Do **not** represent shares, equity, ownership interest or voting rights in ALTBridge Labs S.A. or any affiliate;
* Do **not** entitle holders to dividends, profit share, revenue share, or any form of passive income from the Company;
* Are **not** deposits, bank products, or debt instruments; and
* Are **not** intended to be, and shall not be treated as, securities or investment contracts in any jurisdiction, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

Nothing in these Terms, on the Site, or in any of our communications shall be construed as any form of promise, expectation, or guarantee of future price appreciation or economic return.

#### 5. $ZNS Token Sale and Participation

**5.1 Scope**\
From time to time, the Company may offer $ZNS tokens to eligible users through a token sale, including but not limited to:

* A community pre-sale hosted on our own Site or smart contracts;
* Sales or allocations via third-party launchpads or exchanges; and/or
* Other distribution mechanisms (such as rewards, airdrops, quests, campaigns).

These Terms govern your access to and participation in any $ZNS token sale conducted or facilitated by ALTBridge Labs S.A., in addition to any specific token sale terms, tokenomics schedules, or campaign rules that may apply (collectively, the **“Token Sale Terms”**).

**5.2 Eligibility and Restricted Jurisdictions for Token Sale**\
By participating in any $ZNS token sale, you represent and warrant that:

* You are at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity to enter into these Terms;
* You are not a “U.S. Person” as defined under Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and you are not accessing the Site or participating in the sale from the United States;
* You are **not** a resident, citizen, or located in any jurisdiction where participation in token sales, initial coin offerings, or similar activities is restricted, prohibited, or would require registration, licensing, authorization, or approval of the Company, including (without limitation) the USA, the European Union, the United Kingdom, or any jurisdiction under comprehensive sanctions;
* You are not listed on, and are not acting on behalf of any person or entity listed on, any sanctions or restricted parties list maintained by the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, or Panama;
* You are participating in the sale on your own behalf, for your own account, and not as nominee, trustee, representative, or agent for any third party; and
* Your participation fully complies with all laws, regulations, and restrictions applicable in your country of residence, citizenship, and location.

The Company may, at its sole discretion, implement geofencing, KYC/AML checks, contribution limits, or other controls and may refuse, cancel, or reverse any attempted contribution that appears to violate these Terms or applicable law.

**5.3 No Refunds and Irreversibility**\
All contributions made in connection with a $ZNS token sale are **final and non-refundable**, unless otherwise required by mandatory applicable law or explicitly stated in the Token Sale Terms.

Due to the nature of blockchain networks:

* Transactions are typically irreversible once confirmed on-chain;
* The Company does not have the ability to reverse or modify completed transactions; and
* The Company is not responsible for any loss resulting from sending funds to the wrong address, using unsupported networks or tokens.

**5.4 Allocation, Vesting, and Delivery**\
The total supply, allocation, vesting schedules, and unlocking mechanics for $ZNS tokens are publicly described in the official Tokenomics documentation available on the Site. Such documentation is incorporated by reference into these Terms for informational purposes only.

You acknowledge and agree that:

* Your entitlement to receive $ZNS is subject to successful completion of the token sale, technical deployment of the smart contracts, and any applicable vesting or lock-up periods;
* Vesting and unlocking schedules may be enforced through smart contracts and/or off-chain mechanisms, and you may not be able to transfer or dispose of your tokens before the applicable vesting or lock-up periods expire; and
* The Company reserves the right to adjust sale timelines, stages, caps, or technical details of the sale (including contract addresses and supported networks) if reasonably necessary for security, regulatory, or operational reasons.

**5.5 No Guarantee of Listing, Liquidity, or Price**\
The Company does not guarantee:

* That $ZNS will be listed on any centralized or decentralized exchange;
* That any secondary market for $ZNS will develop or, if it develops, that it will be liquid or sustainable;
* Any particular price, price range, market capitalization, or trading volume for $ZNS; or
* That you will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of your $ZNS tokens at any time, or at a price equal to or greater than the amount you paid.

Participation in the $ZNS token sale is highly speculative and involves significant risk. You should not participate if you cannot afford to lose the entire value of your contribution.

**5.6 Token Holder Responsibilities and Self-Custody**\
You are solely responsible for:

* Providing a compatible, non-custodial wallet address under your exclusive control for receiving $ZNS tokens;
* Safeguarding your private keys, seed phrases, and any other credentials associated with your digital wallet;
* Ensuring that you do not lose access to your wallet.

The Company does not provide custodial services and cannot recover lost private keys, seed phrases, or access to your wallet. If you lose access to your wallet, your $ZNS tokens may be permanently inaccessible.

**5.7 Tax Responsibilities**\
You are solely responsible for determining, reporting, and paying any and all taxes, duties, levies, or other governmental charges that may be imposed on you in connection with your participation in the $ZNS token sale, your acquisition, holding, or disposal of $ZNS tokens, or any other use of our services.

The Company does not provide tax advice. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of participating in the sale and holding digital assets.

**5.8 Regulatory and Technological Risks**\
You acknowledge and accept that:

* Regulatory frameworks for digital assets and token sales remain uncertain and may change at any time, which could materially impact the $ZNS token, the ZNS Connect ecosystem, or your ability to use or transfer $ZNS;
* Blockchain networks may experience delays, congestion, bugs, forks, cyber-attacks, or other technical issues that may delay or prevent the allocation, transfer, or use of $ZNS; and
* The Company shall not be liable for any loss arising from such regulatory or technological risks, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

**5.9 No Investment or Profit Expectation**\
You acknowledge and agree that you are acquiring $ZNS tokens solely to access and use the ZNS Connect ecosystem and related utilities, and not for any speculative or investment purpose, nor with any expectation of profit, income, or capital gain.

Any discussion by the Company, its team members, or community about potential market performance, comparisons to other tokens, or hypothetical scenarios is purely illustrative and does not constitute a commitment, promise, or financial projection.
