**AGREEMENT TO TERMS**

#### ABOUT THESE TERMS

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement between you and **ALTBridge Labs S.A.** (operating as ZNS Connect) (“Company,” “we,” or “us”) regarding your access to and use of the ZNS Connect websites including https://znsconnect.io, https://zns.bio, and https://app.znsconnect.io, and all related content, products, and services (collectively, the “Site”).

Please note: While ZNS Connect may publish Domain Names or other records to public blockchain networks, these networks are operated by independent third parties and are not part of the Site.

By accessing the Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must discontinue use of the Site immediately.

Supplemental terms, policies, or disclosures linked on the Site are incorporated into these Terms by reference.

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. By continuing to use the Site after such modifications are posted, you agree to the revised Terms.

The Site is not intended for distribution or use in any jurisdiction where such use would violate law or require regulatory registration. Users are responsible for compliance with their local laws.

The Site is intended only for users aged 18 years and older. By using the Site, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age.

#### 1. Web3 Domain Disclosure

Web3 domains reside on public blockchains and grant users ownership over their data and identities. They simplify crypto transactions by replacing complex wallet addresses with human-readable names and serve as decentralized identifiers for applications and platforms across Web3.

Unlike traditional DNS domains, Web3 domains:

* Are not issued or regulated by ICANN.
* Do not use the DNS root zone and thus may not resolve on standard browsers without special plugins or configurations.
* May not be unique across all blockchains and platforms, and could potentially collide with other blockchain-based naming systems or existing DNS domains.

By purchasing or using a ZNS Connect domain, you acknowledge and accept that Web3 naming is an experimental and rapidly evolving space, and that ZNS Connect makes no guarantees regarding long-term resolution compatibility or exclusivity.

#### 2. Eligibility and User Representations

You may use the Site only if you are at least 18 years old and capable of entering into a legally binding agreement.
