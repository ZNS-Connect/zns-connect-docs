# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ("Policy") outlines how ZNS Connect Inc. and its affiliated entities ("Company") collect, use, and share personal information of users of this website, [https://znsconnect.io/](https://znsconnect.io/), as well as any other media form, channel, mobile website, or application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto, which is controlled by the Company (the "Site"), and any associated features, functions, products, services, materials, or other information made available through this website and the Companyâ€™s APIs (collectively, the "Services"). This Policy also pertains to any of our other websites that reference this Policy. However, this Policy does not apply to websites that link to different statements.

**WHAT WE COLLECT**

We may collect your email address, phone number, and other information you directly provide on our Site or through our Services. Specifically, when you opt in to have a 3rd party account verified, such as a DNS record or Twitter user handle, we collect this information and may log it to the blockchain. Additionally, we may enhance the information about you with data from other sources and combine it with information we collect on this Site or through our Services. We automatically log information about you and your computer, including browser type, pages viewed, duration spent on a page, access times, and your interactions with our Site. We may utilize "cookies" to gather such information, which are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website.

**USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The information you input on our Site or Services may be published to the blockchain through our software, enabling you to broadcast a transaction to the blockchain network. Once published, we cannot control how others use your personal information. Your blockchain domain is akin to a "Public Profile," and any information you direct us to publish will be accessible to others. We use your personal information for various purposes, including but not limited to operating, maintaining, and improving our Sites, products, and Services; responding to comments and questions; providing customer service; sending information such as confirmations, invoices, updates, and support messages; and communicating about promotions and other news.

**SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We may share personal information with your consent or as required by law. This includes sharing information in the context of a business deal, for legal protection and safety purposes, to respond to lawful requests and legal processes, to protect our rights and property, and in emergencies. We may also share information with those who need it to perform work for us.

**INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES**

Our marketing emails provide instructions for opting out, though you may still receive non-marketing emails. You can request changes to your personal information and opt out of sharing with others. Most browsers allow you to manage cookies and limit interest-based advertising. However, altering these settings may affect your experience on our Site.

**LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES**

Our Site or Services may contain links to third-party websites or services. Your interactions with these are subject to their rules and policies, not ours. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Our Services are not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 16. If we discover such information has been collected inadvertently, we will promptly delete it.

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at our discretion. Material changes will be communicated to you through email or by prominently posting on our Site. It is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically.
