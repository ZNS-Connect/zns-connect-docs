# ↘️ Privacy Policy

**Introduction:** ALTBridge Labs S.A. (“ALTBridge”, “Company”, “we”, or “u&#x73;**”**)**,** a Panamanian legal entity, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect personal data when you use ZNS Connect and related services, including our websites **zns.bio** and **znsconnect.io** (collectively, the “Services”). It also explains your rights regarding your personal data. By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Services.

### **PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT**

We collect personal data (information that can identify you) in the following ways:

* Information You Provide: When you interact with our Services, you may provide certain information directly. This includes:
  * Wallet Address: If you connect a blockchain wallet to use ZNS Connect, we collect your public wallet address (a blockchain identifier tied to your account). This is used as your user identifier within our Service.
  * Email Address: If you choose to provide an email address (for example, to receive updates, newsletters, or for account recovery), we will collect and store your email in our database.
* Information Collected Automatically: We collect certain data automatically when you use our websites:
  * IP Address and Device Information: We log your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type, operating system, browser type, and similar technical information when you access our sites.
  * Usage Data: We monitor your activity on our sites, such as pages visited, features used, time spent on pages, and click-stream data. This usage information is collected to help us understand how users engage with our Services and to improve user experience. We utilize cookies and similar tracking technologies (described below) to gather some of this data.
* Cookies and Tracking: Our websites use cookies, pixels, and analytics tools (such as Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics) to collect usage data. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that help us recognize you and remember your preferences. For example, we use Google Analytics (via Google Tag Manager) to collect information about how visitors use our site, which helps us analyze traffic and improve the Services. These third-party analytics services may receive your IP address and other usage data when you visit our site, and their use of your data is governed by their own privacy policies.

### HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We use the collected personal data for the following purposes:

* Providing and Improving Services: To operate, maintain, and improve ZNS Connect and our related websites, products, and Services. For example, your wallet address is used to enable domain registration and management features, and usage data helps us optimize our user interface and performance.
* Communication: To communicate with you about your use of the Services. If you provided an email, we may send service-related communications (e.g., confirmations of domain registrations, technical notices, updates or security alerts) and respond to your inquiries or support requests. We may also send promotional updates or newsletters about new features or offers **with your consent**, and you can opt out of these marketing emails at any time.
* Analytics and Research: To analyze usage of our websites and Services (via cookies and third-party analytics like Google Analytics) in order to understand user behavior and trends. This helps us make informed decisions on improving functionality and content.
* Security and Fraud Prevention: To monitor, prevent, and detect fraud, unauthorized activities, and other potential misuse of the Services. For example, we may use IP addresses and other identifiers to detect multiple accounts or suspicious behavior and to **protect the integrity** of our platform.
* Legal Compliance: To comply with applicable legal obligations and regulatory requirements. For instance, we may use or preserve certain data to fulfill record-keeping obligations, enforce our Terms of Use, or handle any disputes.
* Other Operational Purposes: We may use data for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, testing, and research to maintain and improve service quality. If we ever need to use personal data for a purpose that is incompatible with those listed above, we will obtain your consent or provide the required notice.

### COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

Cookies and Similar Technologies: We and our third-party partners use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your interaction with our Services. Cookies help us remember your preferences and recognize you across sessions. Some cookies are **essential** for site functionality (for example, to keep you logged in or remember settings), while others are used for **analytics** and improvement (e.g., understanding which pages are popular).

The analytics tools we use (such as Google Analytics) place their own cookies to collect data on user behaviors. This data may include your IP address, browser type, referral URL, and on-site interactions. We use this information to compile reports and to help us improve the site. We do **not** use cookies for advertising or profiling purposes at this time, and we do not allow third-party advertising networks to track you on our sites.

Your Choices: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can typically modify your browser settings to decline cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. If you prefer not to accept cookies, you can **disable** them by adjusting your browser settings (for example, you may have the option to block all cookies or to receive a notification before a cookie is stored). Please note that if you disable or reject cookies, some features of our Services may not function properly or your experience may be degraded.

For Google Analytics specifically, Google provides an opt-out mechanism (such as a browser add-on) if you wish to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics. Additionally, we honor any applicable settings or signals (like “Do Not Track” preferences) to the extent required by law.

### HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We do **not sell** your personal data. However, we may **share** your data with select third parties in the following circumstances:

* Service Providers: We share information with trusted third-party companies that perform services on our behalf. This includes, for example, infrastructure and hosting providers, technical service providers, analytics vendors, and email delivery services. These partners process data only as necessary to provide their services to us and are contractually obligated to protect it. For instance, we use Google Analytics (a service provided by Google LLC) for usage analytics, which means Google may process certain usage data and IP addresses for that purpose.
* Affiliates: If ALTBridge Labs S.A. has affiliate companies or subsidiaries, we may share your information within our corporate family. Any such entities will handle your data in accordance with this Policy.
* With Your Consent or Direction: We will share your personal data with third parties if you have given us your consent to do so, or if you intentionally use our Services to share information with others. **For example, if you publish personal information to a blockchain via our Service, you are consenting to make that information public and share it with anyone who can access the blockchain**. _(See the “Blockchain Data” section below.)_
* Business Transfers: If we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of that deal. We will ensure any successor entity honors the commitments in this Privacy Policy or provides you notice and choices before your data is subject to a different policy.
* Legal Compliance and Protection: We may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or request (e.g., a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement request), or to protect our rights, property, and safety, or those of our users or others. This includes enforcing our Terms of Use or other agreements, detecting and addressing fraud or security issues, and reducing credit risk.
* Emergency Situations: If someone’s life, health, or security is at risk, and disclosure of data could potentially prevent harm, we might share information as reasonably necessary to protect individuals’ vital interests.

When we share data with service providers or other third parties, we only provide the minimum amount of personal data necessary for them to carry out their responsibilities. Third parties who receive personal data from us are expected to handle it with an appropriate level of confidentiality and security, and they are not permitted to use it for any purpose other than the specific service they are providing to us (unless they are independently data controllers, such as Google in the case of analytics data, in which case their own privacy terms apply as well).









Our marketing emails provide instructions for opting out, though you may still receive non-marketing emails. You can request changes to your personal information and opt out of sharing with others. Most browsers allow you to manage cookies and limit interest-based advertising. However, altering these settings may affect your experience on our Site.

**LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES**

Our Site or Services may contain links to third-party websites or services. Your interactions with these are subject to their rules and policies, not ours. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Our Services are not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 16. If we discover such information has been collected inadvertently, we will promptly delete it.

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at our discretion. Material changes will be communicated to you through email or by prominently posting on our Site. It is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically.
