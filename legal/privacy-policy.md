# ↘️ Privacy Policy

**Introduction:** ALTBridge Labs S.A. (“ALTBridge”, “Company”, “**we**”, or “**us”), a** Panamanian legal entity, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect personal data when you use ZNS Connect and related services, including our websites **zns.bio** and **znsconnect.io** (collectively, the “**Services**”). It also explains your rights regarding your personal data. By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Services.

PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT

We collect **personal data** (information that can identify you) in the following ways:

* Information You Provide: When you interact with our Services, you may provide certain information directly. This includes:
  * Wallet Address: If you connect a blockchain wallet to use ZNS Connect, we collect your public wallet address (a blockchain identifier tied to your account). This is used as your user identifier within our Service.
  * Email Address: If you choose to provide an email address (for example, to receive updates, newsletters, or for account recovery), we will collect and store your email in our database.
* Information Collected Automatically: We collect certain data automatically when you use our websites:
  * IP Address and Device Information: We log your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type, operating system, browser type, and similar technical information when you access our sites.
  * Usage Data: We monitor your activity on our sites, such as pages visited, features used, time spent on pages, and click-stream data. This usage information is collected to help us understand how users engage with our Services and to improve user experience. We utilize cookies and similar tracking technologies (described below) to gather some of this data.
* Cookies and Tracking: Our websites use cookies, pixels, and analytics tools (such as **Google Tag Manager** and **Google Analytics**) to collect usage data. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that help us recognize you and remember your preferences. For example, we use Google Analytics (via Google Tag Manager) to collect information about how visitors use our site, which helps us analyze traffic and improve the Services. These third-party analytics services may receive your IP address and other usage data when you visit our site, and their use of your data is governed by their own privacy policies.

No Social Login or Third-Party Identity Services: We do **not** use any social media logins or third-party identity verification services for authentication. You do not need to log in with Google, Facebook, or any similar provider to use ZNS Connect. Your blockchain wallet (and optional email) are the primary identifiers we use. This means we do not collect information from social networks or external identity providers as part of your use of the Services.

**USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The information you input on our Site or Services may be published to the blockchain through our software, enabling you to broadcast a transaction to the blockchain network. Once published, we cannot control how others use your personal information. Your blockchain domain is akin to a "Public Profile," and any information you direct us to publish will be accessible to others. We use your personal information for various purposes, including but not limited to operating, maintaining, and improving our Sites, products, and Services; responding to comments and questions; providing customer service; sending information such as confirmations, invoices, updates, and support messages; and communicating about promotions and other news.

**SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We may share personal information with your consent or as required by law. This includes sharing information in the context of a business deal, for legal protection and safety purposes, to respond to lawful requests and legal processes, to protect our rights and property, and in emergencies. We may also share information with those who need it to perform work for us.

**INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES**

Our marketing emails provide instructions for opting out, though you may still receive non-marketing emails. You can request changes to your personal information and opt out of sharing with others. Most browsers allow you to manage cookies and limit interest-based advertising. However, altering these settings may affect your experience on our Site.

**LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES**

Our Site or Services may contain links to third-party websites or services. Your interactions with these are subject to their rules and policies, not ours. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Our Services are not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 16. If we discover such information has been collected inadvertently, we will promptly delete it.

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at our discretion. Material changes will be communicated to you through email or by prominently posting on our Site. It is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically.
