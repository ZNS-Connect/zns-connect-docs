## **5. Smart Contract, Blockchain, and Technical Risks**

ZNS Connect relies on decentralized infrastructure, which may contain:

* network outages
* chain reorganizations
* mismatched RPC indexing
* unsupported wallet behavior

These issues may prevent you from:

* minting domains
* receiving tokens

* claiming rewards

The Company does not control blockchain networks and cannot guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.

ZNS domains are blockchain-based digital identifiers and are not traditional ICANN or DNS domains.\
They may not be recognized or resolvable by legacy internet systems, browsers, search engines, or naming protocols.

Domain risks include:

* loss of access due to lost wallets or private keys
* incompatibility with certain apps or wallets
* inability to transfer or modify domains
* potential trademark or intellectual property conflicts
* dependency on blockchain networks and smart contract functionality
* irreversible minting and ownership records

The Company cannot mediate disputes or recover domain ownership.

## **6. Market, Price, and Liquidity Risks**

The value of digital assets depends on third-party exchanges and user demand.

There is no guarantee that any secondary market for $ZNS will exist or remain active.\
The Company does not guarantee:

* listing on centralized or decentralized exchanges
* liquidity in any trading pair
* ability to buy or sell $ZNS at any time
* any specific market capitalization or trading volume
* any future demand or adoption

Token markets may experience extreme volatility, manipulation attempts, or complete disappearance.

## **7. Regulatory and Jurisdictional Risks**

Digital asset laws vary across jurisdictions and may change at any time.\
Regulatory actions may:

* restrict token transfers
* limit user access
* require KYC/AML procedures
* enforce reporting, licensing, or compliance
* prohibit participation based on residency

The Company may modify or suspend services to comply with applicable laws.

## **8. Decentralized Domain Naming Risks**

* are recorded on blockchain networks
* may not work with all browsers or services
* may conflict with existing DNS/brand systems
* may not be recognized by other naming protocols
* may depend on third-party resolvers
* cannot be “deleted” or “revoked” due to blockchain immutability

ZNS Connect does not guarantee:

* cross-chain uniqueness
* interoperability with other naming services
* trademark or IP protection
* compatibility with all dApps or wallets

The user is solely responsible for ensuring they do not infringe on trademarks or third-party rights.

## **9. Third-Party Services and Integration Risks**

ZNS Connect relies on:

* blockchain networks
* RPC providers
* bridges
* explorers
* wallets
* nodes
* storage systems
* DNS resolvers
* analytics services

These services operate independently of ZNS Connect.

Failures, delays, bugs, hacks, configuration errors, or service interruptions from these third parties may impact domain resolution, token delivery, contract execution, or platform functionality.

ALTBridge Labs S.A. is not responsible for the performance or failures of any third-party provider.
