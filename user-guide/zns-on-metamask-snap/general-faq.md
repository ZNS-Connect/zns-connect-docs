# General FAQ



1\. What is the ZNS Connect Web3 Domain Snap?

MetaMask Snaps are modular extensions that allow developers to add custom functionality to MetaMask in a secure, permissioned way. The **ZNS Connect Web3 Domain Snap** is a MetaMask extension that allows users to resolve and interact with **ZNS domains** directly inside their MetaMask wallet.

**Link to install:** [https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zns-connect/](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zns-connect/)

#### 2. How does the ZNS Connect Web3 Domain Snap work?

The Snap allows users to resolve **.zns domains** (and other supported ZNS TLDs) across EVM-compatible chains directly into wallet addresses within MetaMask. This means users can send assets simply by typing in a domain (e.g., `alice.zns`) instead of a long wallet address — improving both user experience and transaction safety.

3. Approve the Snap installation when prompted.
4. Your MetaMask will now resolve ZNS domains automatically when entered in the “Send To” field.

#### 6. Is the ZNS Connect Snap free to use?

Yes! The Snap is completely free.\
Users only pay the standard domain registration fee and any gas fees required for transfers. ZNS Connect charges no additional fees for domain resolution functionality via Snap.

***

#### 7. Is my data tracked?

Users have full control over what is shared. During the signature process, users can choose whether to share domain lookup data with ZNS Connect. If shared, this is used only for internal analytics (e.g., performance tracking or campaign rewards). No user data is sold or publicly disclosed.
