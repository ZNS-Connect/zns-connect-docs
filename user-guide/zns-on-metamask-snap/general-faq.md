# ⏩ General FAQ



1\. What is the ZNS Connect Web3 Domain Snap?

MetaMask Snaps are modular extensions that allow developers to add custom functionality to MetaMask in a secure, permissioned way. The **ZNS Connect Web3 Domain Snap** is a MetaMask extension that allows users to resolve and interact with **ZNS domains** directly inside their MetaMask wallet.

***

#### 2. How does the ZNS Connect Web3 Domain Snap work?

The Snap allows users to resolve **.zns domains** (and other supported ZNS TLDs) across EVM-compatible chains directly into wallet addresses within MetaMask. This means users can send assets simply by typing in a domain (e.g., `alice.zns`) instead of a long wallet address — improving both user experience and transaction safety.

***

#### 3. Which domains are supported by the ZNS Connect Snap?

The Snap supports all domain names issued by **ZNS Connect** that are deployed on EVM-compatible chains. Popular examples include `.zns`, `.defi`, `.ink`, `.hvm`, and more — all resolvable in MetaMask for seamless transfers.

You can explore and mint domains here: [https://zns.bio](https://zns.bio/)

***

#### 4. What is ZNS Connect’s version of “Payment ID”?

While ZNS doesn't use a centralized Payment ID format (like `user@exchange`), our naming system serves a similar function — offering readable, universal addresses for wallet interactions across wallets and dApps. For example, `nina.hvm` or `vitalik.defi` can be used for direct transfers via MetaMask once the Snap is enabled.

***

#### 5. How do I enable the ZNS Connect Web3 Domain Snap?

1. Make sure you're using **MetaMask Extension v12.4.2 or higher**.
2. Visit the ZNS Snap install page (coming soon) or find it in the MetaMask Snap Directory.
3. Approve the Snap installation when prompted.
4. Your MetaMask will now resolve ZNS domains automatically when entered in the “Send To” field.

***

#### 6. Is the ZNS Connect Snap free to use?

Yes! The Snap is completely free.\
Users only pay the standard domain registration fee and any gas fees required for transfers. ZNS Connect charges no additional fees for domain resolution functionality via Snap.

***

#### 7. Is my data tracked?

Users have full control over what is shared. During the signature process, users can choose whether to share domain lookup data with ZNS Connect. If shared, this is used only for internal analytics (e.g., performance tracking or campaign rewards). No user data is sold or publicly disclosed.

***

#### 8. Has the ZNS Snap been audited?

The Snap will undergo standard auditing practices, with third-party reviews planned before mainnet rollout.
