# Tokenomics

&#x20;ZNS Token (ZNT) Utility

&#x20;The ZNS Connect Name Service (ZNS) has its native utility token called ZNS Token (ZNT). The ZNT token serves multiple purposes within the Zetachain ecosystem. By holding ZNT tokens, users become integral contributors to the ecosystem's growth and sustainability, fostering engagement and incentivizing their active involvement. The introduction of the ZNT token positions ZNS Connect as a prominent player in the Web3 industry, providing users with a comprehensive platform to effectively manage their digital identities.

**Continuing the utilities of the ZNT token within the ZNS Connect ecosystem**:

**1. Premium Accounts:** ZNT tokens can be used to purchase premium accounts, unlocking additional features and benefits within the ZNS Connect platform.

**2. Social Engagement:** ZNT tokens can be added as likes or reactions below posts within the ZNS App, enhancing social interactions and user engagement on the platform.

**3. Giveaways and Raffles:** ZNT tokens can be utilized for giveaways and raffles conducted between social accounts within the ZNS App, creating exciting opportunities for community participation and rewards.

**4. Staking:** ZNT tokens can be staked, allowing users to earn rewards or benefits, such as additional ZNT tokens or discounts, based on their staking activity.

**5. Governance:** ZNT token holders have the opportunity to participate in the governance of the ZNS Connect platform. This involves voting on proposals and decisions that shape the future development and direction of the ecosystem.

## 5.2 Token Distribution and Allocation

The initial distribution of ZNT tokens is typically conducted through a combination of private and public sales. During the private sale, early investors and strategic partners have the opportunity to acquire ZNT tokens at a discounted price. The public sale, often conducted through a token sale event like an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or Initial DEX Offering (IDO), allows the broader community to participate and purchase ZNT tokens.

The token allocation is carefully designed to support the long-term sustainability and growth of the ZNS ecosystem. The distribution may include allocations for the development team, advisors, marketing initiatives, liquidity pools, and community incentives. The exact token distribution and allocation details are typically outlined in the project's whitepaper or tokenomics documentation.

## 5.3 Governance Mechanism

The governance mechanism of the ZNS protocol ensures that the community has a say in the decision-making process. Token holders can actively participate in the governance process by voting on proposals and protocol upgrades. These proposals can cover a wide range of topics, including network upgrades, parameter adjustments, fee structures, and platform improvements.

The governance mechanism is typically implemented through a voting system where each ZNT token holder has voting power proportional to their token holdings. Proposals are submitted by community members or the development team, and token holders can cast their votes to approve or reject these proposals. The governance process aims to foster transparency, decentralization, and community-driven decision-making within the ZNS ecosystem.
