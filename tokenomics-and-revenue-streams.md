## 5.1 ZNS Token (ZNT) Utility

&#x20;The ZNS Connect Name Service (ZNS) has its native utility token called ZNS Token (ZNT). The ZNT token serves multiple purposes within the Zetachain ecosystem.

Firstly, ZNT is used as a means of payment for various services provided by the ZNS platform. Users can utilize ZNT to register domain names, transfer ownership of domains, and access premium features or additional functionalities within the ZNS ecosystem.

Additionally, ZNT tokens play a crucial role in the governance of the ZNS protocol. Token holders can participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals and protocol upgrades. This governance mechanism ensures that the community has a voice in shaping the future development and direction of the ZNS platform.

Furthermore, ZNT tokens may also be used as a staking mechanism, allowing token holders to contribute to the security and stability of the ZNS network. Stakers can lock up their ZNT tokens as collateral to validate transactions, secure the network, and earn staking rewards.

## 5.2 Token Distribution and Allocation

The initial distribution of ZNT tokens is typically conducted through a combination of private and public sales. During the private sale, early investors and strategic partners have the opportunity to acquire ZNT tokens at a discounted price. The public sale, often conducted through a token sale event like an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or Initial DEX Offering (IDO), allows the broader community to participate and purchase ZNT tokens.

The token allocation is carefully designed to support the long-term sustainability and growth of the ZNS ecosystem. The distribution may include allocations for the development team, advisors, marketing initiatives, liquidity pools, and community incentives. The exact token distribution and allocation details are typically outlined in the project's whitepaper or tokenomics documentation.

## 5.3 Governance Mechanism

The governance mechanism of the ZNS protocol ensures that the community has a say in the decision-making process. Token holders can actively participate in the governance process by voting on proposals and protocol upgrades. These proposals can cover a wide range of topics, including network upgrades, parameter adjustments, fee structures, and platform improvements.

The governance mechanism is typically implemented through a voting system where each ZNT token holder has voting power proportional to their token holdings. Proposals are submitted by community members or the development team, and token holders can cast their votes to approve or reject these proposals. The governance process aims to foster transparency, decentralization, and community-driven decision-making within the ZNS ecosystem.

## 5.4 Current Revenue Streams:

1. Domain Registration Fees: Users pay a fee to register and manage their domain names on the Zetachain Name Service (ZNS) platform.
2. Transaction Fees: ZNS collects a small transaction fee for each domain transfer or update made on the platform.
3. Premium Domain Sales: Premium domain names with high market value are listed for sale, generating revenue from domain name auctions or direct sales.
4. Partnerships and Integrations: ZNS collaborates with other blockchain projects, decentralized applications, and platforms, generating revenue through strategic partnerships, licensing, and integration fees.

## 5.5  Planned Revenue Streams:

1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Integration: ZNS aims to integrate with DeFi platforms, enabling users to utilize their domain names as collateral or participate in domain-related financial activities, generating revenue from transaction fees or token staking mechanisms.
2. Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Marketplace: ZNS plans to launch an NFT marketplace where users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs linked to their ZNS domains, earning revenue through transaction fees or commissions.
3. Domain Name Auctions: ZNS will introduce domain name auctions, allowing users to bid on premium or desirable domain names, generating revenue from auction fees and successful bids.
4. Value-Added Services: ZNS will offer additional services, such as domain name appraisals, premium listing placements, and personalized branding packages, providing users with enhanced features for a fee.

These revenue streams, along with continuous growth and adoption of the ZNS ecosystem, will contribute to the project's financial sustainability and long-term success.
