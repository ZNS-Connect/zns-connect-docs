# ðŸŽ“ ZNS Grant Program

**Categories and Tracks The ZNS Grant Program encompasses two primary categories for project proposals:**

1. **Domain Integration:** Projects focusing on the seamless integration of Web3 Name SDK and Web3 domains with ZNS SDK/API.
2. **ZNS Ecosystem Development:** Projects dedicated to launching innovative DApps that support ZNS web3 domains, including .cz, .xlayer, .poly, and other upcoming TLDs. This category also includes initiatives aimed at deploying deeper DID integrations, enhancing domain utilities, exploring new use cases, and more.

### **Applicants have the option to select from five distinct tracks:**

1. Wallet Track: Projects aimed at enhancing asset transfer and user experience within accounts through domains. We especially encourage the development of MPC or smart contract wallets with Account Abstraction capabilities.
2. DApps Track: Development of decentralized web or cross-chain applications that leverage memorable Web3 domains instead of conventional wallet addresses.
3. Gaming Track: Creating engaging applications that integrate domains to enrich user experience in gaming environments.
4. Tooling Track: Development of Web3 tools or infrastructure directly related to domains, such as on-chain data search capabilities via domains.
5. CEX Track: Support for asset deposit and withdrawal facilitated through domains.

### **Assessment Criteria and Judging Projects will be evaluated by the ZNS core team based on:**

1. Daily Active Users: User engagement levels.
2. Integration Utility: Project's usefulness.
3. Integration Strength: Depth of integration with SPACE ID.
