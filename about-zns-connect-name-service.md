### What is ZNS?

<mark style="color:green;">ZNS Connect Name Service (ZNS)</mark> is a decentralized naming system built on the Zetachain blockchain. It provides a user-friendly and memorable way to identify and interact with participants within the web3 ecosystem. With ZNS, users can replace complex and lengthy blockchain addresses with human-readable names, making it easier to send and receive transactions, interact with decentralized applications (dApps), and establish online identities.

### 2.2 Core Components:

**2.2.1 Domain Registration:** Domain registration is a fundamental component of ZNS. Users can register their unique and personalized domain names on the Zetachain network. These domain names serve as identifiers for individuals, organizations, projects, or any other entity within the blockchain ecosystem. By registering a domain, users claim ownership and control over their chosen name, enabling them to associate it with their blockchain accounts, dApps, or other digital assets.

**2.2.2 Domain Resolution:** Domain resolution is the process through which the ZNS system translates human-readable domain names into corresponding blockchain addresses. When a user enters a ZNS domain name in a web browser or a dApp, the ZNS network resolves it to the associated blockchain address, allowing for seamless and intuitive interaction. This resolution process is crucial for ensuring the smooth functioning of ZNS and enhancing user experience.

**2.2.3 ERC721 Integration:** ZNS integrates with the ERC721 standard, which is widely used for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging ERC721 integration, ZNS enables users to link their NFT collections or specific NFTs to their domain names. This functionality allows for easy verification and authentication of NFT ownership, providing a trusted and transparent way for buyers to ensure the authenticity and origin of the artworks or collectibles they are interested in.

**2.2.4 Smart Contract Architecture:** Smart contracts play a vital role in the ZNS ecosystem. ZNS utilizes a sophisticated smart contract architecture that powers the registration, resolution, and management of domain names. These smart contracts ensure the security, transparency, and immutability of the ZNS system. They govern the rules and processes for domain registration, ownership transfer, and domain resolution, providing a robust and trustless framework for the functioning of ZNS.
