# 4 Use Cases

### **4.1 Decentralized Web3 Identity:**&#x20;

ZNS enables individuals and organizations to establish their decentralized web identities. By registering unique domain names on the ZNS platform, users can associate their blockchain addresses with these names, creating a recognizable and persistent identity. This decentralized web identity allows for secure and authenticated interactions within the blockchain ecosystem, promoting privacy, ownership, and control over personal data.

### **4.2 Simplified Addressing and User Experience:**&#x20;

ZNS simplifies the addressing system within the blockchain ecosystem. Instead of using complex and hard-to-remember hexadecimal addresses, users can utilize their registered domain names to send and receive transactions. This enhances the user experience by providing a more user-friendly and intuitive method of interacting with blockchain-based applications, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving adoption.

ZNS offers a valuable solution for NFT (Non-Fungible Token) and art verification. Artists and creators can link their NFT collections to their registered domain names, providing a verifiable connection between their artistic works and their domain identity. This verification enhances trust and authenticity in the art market, enabling buyers to confidently verify the origin and ownership of NFTs before making a purchase.
