# Refund Policy

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in this Terms of Service, all fees for domain name registrations and associated domain name Service(s) are eligible for a full refund of the purchase price within 14 days of purchase. However, domains purchased with cryptocurrency must be requested for a refund within 5 days of purchase. Refunds will be processed using the same payment method used for the purchase, based on the USD value at the time of refund.

Only the purchase price of the domain will be refunded; any claim fees, blockchain fees, or other related fees paid by you will not be refunded.

ZNS Connect reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse to sell a domain name to you for any reason or to cancel a sale once initiated.

In certain circumstances, fees from new domain name registrations may be refunded at the sole discretion of ZNS Connect. Such circumstances include issues related to trademark infringement, phishing, technical limitations on name resolutions, mispriced sales, and legal requirements.

Refunds will be credited to your profile on our website using the original payment method or as store credit.

For payments made with cryptocurrency, refunds will be processed in the equivalent amount of USD received. You are responsible for any exchange rate fluctuations between the time of the original payment and the refund issuance.

Once a domain is live on the blockchain and transferred to your control, it is considered under your ownership. ZNS Connect cannot refund the purchase funds or reclaim the domain. However, if you cover the transfer fees, we can refund the original purchase once the domain is returned within the specified timelines.

If you received store credit or promotional items with your domain purchase and seek a refund, you must return the purchased domain and forfeit any additional promotional items or credits. If you minted any domains with promotional credit, those must also be returned for a refund.

Purchases made with promotional credits are non-refundable and not eligible for exchanges. Domains purchased with promotional credits cannot be exchanged, even in case of typos.

Fees paid for preorders, "sunrise" registration, early access programs, domain minting, and Twitter verification credits are non-refundable.
